# DeepSeek V4 Flash DSpark C12 NVFP4 KV on 2x DGX Spark

Self-contained two-node DGX Spark recipe for serving `DeepSeek-V4-Flash-DSpark`
with vLLM TP=2, DSpark speculative decoding, and a 1M-token max model length
using the experimental `nvfp4_ds_mla` KV-cache path.

This repo includes Keys' DSpark concurrency patch in the vLLM overlay. That
patch makes DSpark's persistent draft KV follow request identity instead of
condensed batch-row position, and adds ragged mixed prefill/decode handling for
real independent sessions.

The live launcher also bind-mounts
`recipe/vllm/v1/spec_decode/dspark_proposer.py` over the image proposer. That
runtime copy carries Keys' `req_ids` slot mapping plus a non-uniform batch
guard: when async scheduling mixes prefill and decode in one step, the proposer
skips speculation instead of raising and killing the worker. The start script
syncs this file to the worker before `docker compose up`.

The current local run profile is configured for:

- `max_model_len=1048576`
- `max_num_seqs=6`
- `kv_cache_dtype=nvfp4_ds_mla`
- `gpu_memory_utilization=0.85`
- API bind address `0.0.0.0:8888`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This profile is meant for real deep-context agent serving: up to **1M tokens
> per separate session** with `MAX_NUM_SEQS=6`. The KV cache is a shared pool,
> so six sessions do not each reserve 1M tokens up front. Normal agent
> sessions can run concurrently while retaining the 1M ceiling for unusually

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For long coding tasks and big prompts, use:
>
> ```env
> MAX_MODEL_LEN=1048576
> MAX_NUM_SEQS=4
> MAX_NUM_BATCHED_TOKENS=16384
> GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION=0.87
> ```

This repo captures the validated Stage C NVFP4 runtime, the 2026-06-30
agent-stability refresh, and the 2026-07-02 Keys C12 checkpoint:

- `max_model_len=1048576`
- `max_num_seqs=6`
- `kv_cache_dtype=nvfp4_ds_mla`
- reported KV pool: `3,225,280 tokens`
- configured active sequence slots: `6`
- single-stream decode stayed above `50 tok/s`
- deterministic direct prompts completed with no Chinese drift or repeated junk
- 2/4/6 concurrent code-gate prompts completed cleanly
- DSpark in-server concurrency patch validated at `max_model_len=200000`,
  `max_num_seqs=16`, with static C16 at `315.1 tok/s` aggregate and
  staggered C16 at `205.0 tok/s` aggregate

If you already deployed an older copy and saw agent garble, loops, Chinese
drift, or prompt/tool XML leaking into replies, keep the C12 NVFP4 profile and
validate direct API behavior before changing agent harness settings. The fix
path does not switch production to fp8 or a smaller fallback model.

> [!WARNING]

## Result

### 2026-07-02 Keys C12 NVFP4 Checkpoint

The current high-concurrency lane keeps Tony's known-good Stage C NVFP4 image
and applies Keys' C12 serving profile.

Runtime:

- endpoint tested: `http://100.90.25.78:8888/v1`
- served model: `deepseek-v4-flash-dspark`
- image: `vllm-dspark-runtime:dspark-nvfp4-stage-c`
- model path: `/cache/huggingface/fraserprice/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-DSpark`
- `kv_cache_dtype=nvfp4_ds_mla`
- `max_model_len=1048576`
- `max_num_seqs=6`
- `max_num_batched_tokens=8192`
- `gpu_memory_utilization=0.85`
- `MTP_NUM_TOKENS=3`
- `VLLM_USE_FLASHINFER_SAMPLER=1`
- `VLLM_USE_B12X_WO_PROJECTION=1`
- `VLLM_DSPARK_GPU_REJECTED_CONTEXT_MASK=1`
- `thinking=false`
- `--generation-config vllm`
- no `--override-generation-config`

Boot evidence:

```text
GPU KV cache size: 3,225,280 tokens
Maximum concurrency for 1,000,000 tokens per request: ~3.2x
Application startup complete.
```

Code-gate validation:

| concurrency | success | server generation tok/s | acceptance | bad outputs |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 1/1 | 52.79 | 0.585 | 0 |
| 2 | 2/2 | 79.76 | 0.600 | 0 |

| 6 | 6/6 | 127.78 | 0.615 | 0 |
| 12 | 12/12 | 230.10 | 0.602 | 0 |

The upstream checkpoint note for this run was not imported into this checkout;
this repo keeps the runtime changes and validation summary without the upstream
benchmark artifact folder.

Do not enable `VLLM_USE_B12X_FP8_GEMM=1` on this Stage C image. That flag hit a
DeepGEMM layout assertion during DSpark drafter warmup in testing.

### 2026-06-30 Clean Agent-Serving Checkpoint

The prior conservative clean endpoint was reproduced on Asusi/Spark4 before
sending the model back through Hermes/OpenClaw-style harnesses.

Runtime:

- endpoint tested: `http://100.90.25.78:8888/v1`
- served model: `deepseek-v4-flash-dspark`
- image used on that lane: `vllm-dspark-runtime:mia-raf-pr1-nvfp4-keys-c`
- model path: `/cache/huggingface/fraserprice/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-DSpark`
- `kv_cache_dtype=nvfp4_ds_mla`
- `max_model_len=1048576`
- `max_num_seqs=6`
- `max_num_batched_tokens=8192`
- `gpu_memory_utilization=0.80`
- `MTP_NUM_TOKENS=5`
- `thinking=false`
- `--generation-config vllm`
- `--override-generation-config '{"temperature":0.0,"top_p":1.0}'`
- explicit per-node `VLLM_HOST_IP` values

Boot evidence:

```text
GPU KV cache size: 1,990,142 tokens
Maximum concurrency for 1,048,576 tokens per request: 1.90x
Application startup complete.
```

Direct validation:

- `/v1/models` reported `"max_model_len": 1048576`
- deterministic sanity prompt returned `NVFP4 DSPARK OK`
- five longer English prompts completed with no CJK drift and no repeated junk
- code-gate server decode mean: `54.22 tok/s`
- 2/4/6 concurrent direct prompts all succeeded cleanly

Concurrency:

| concurrency | success | aggregate tok/s | stability |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 2 | 2/2 | 60.95 | no CJK/repeat junk |
| 4 | 4/4 | 83.21 | no CJK/repeat junk |
| 6 | 6/6 | 104.11 | no CJK/repeat junk |

The upstream checkpoint note for this run was not imported into this checkout.

### 1M NVFP4 Profile

Validated on 2x DGX Spark, one GPU per node, TP=2, single stream.

| Case | server tok/s | TTFC | acceptance | accepted/draft |

```

The upstream checkpoint note for this run was not imported into this checkout.

### DSpark Concurrency Profile

Validated on the same 2x DGX Spark TP=2 deployment using Keys' DSpark
concurrency patch, `kv_cache_dtype=nvfp4_ds_mla`, `max_model_len=200000`,
`max_num_seqs=16`, `MTP_NUM_TOKENS=5`, and
`VLLM_DSPARK_GPU_REJECTED_CONTEXT_MASK=1`.

Patch source:

- [drowzeys/Keys-Concurrency-Patch-for-DSpark-DeepSeek-V4-Flash](https://github.com/drowzeys/Keys-Concurrency-Patch-for-DSpark-DeepSeek-V4-Flash)
- Tested patch commit: `7e4d94bbcec95223550517c0fa9244e59f9f6483`

The live fix documented here keeps `kv_cache_dtype=nvfp4_ds_mla` and refreshes
the repo's already-vendored Keys overlay with the path-adjusted Patch 2b update
from that commit. In Patch 2b, ragged `query_start_loc` detection no longer
depends on `num_rejected_tokens_gpu`. Treat the service as validated only after
the built-in OpenAI-compatible chat smoke request plus agent-client validation
pass on the live service.

Static simultaneous batch, one TP=2 replica:

| concurrency | best aggregate tok/s | per-stream tok/s | acceptance |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 57.6 | 57.6 | 0.635 |
| 4 | 140.8 | 35.2 | 0.619 |
| 8 | 252.6 | 31.6 | 0.635 |
| 16 | 315.1 | 19.7 | 0.609 |

Staggered independent arrivals, one TP=2 replica:

| concurrency | success | aggregate tok/s | acceptance |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 4 | 4/4 | 109.2 | 0.544 |
| 8 | 8/8 | 147.3 | 0.534 |
| 16 | 16/16 | 205.0 | 0.567 |

Correctness sanity check: deterministic victim output remained byte-identical
under churn. A medium-churn condense test measured `0.529` acceptance and
`99.7 tok/s` across the churn window.

The upstream checkpoint note for this run was not imported into this checkout.

### Historical 60 tok/s DSpark Baseline

The older ~60 tok/s number was reproduced, but it is a separate diagnostic
profile, not this repo's default 1M NVFP4 deployment:

- image rebuilt from `rafaelcaricio/vllm#1` commit `3519c3b88`
- `max_model_len=262144`
- `max_num_seqs=1`
- `kv_cache_dtype=fp8`
- `MTP_NUM_TOKENS=5`
- `thinking=false`
- `temperature=0.0`, `top_p=1.0`
- measured `63.97 tok/s` on the `code_completion` gate with `67.9%`
  DSpark acceptance

Use this to diagnose image/runtime drift. Do not confuse it with the production
1M NVFP4 path. The upstream checkpoint note for this run was not imported into
this checkout.

### 2026-06-29 Full-1M Concurrency Microbench

The 200K/16 profile above maximizes raw concurrency. For agent fleets that want
the **full 1M context ceiling AND concurrency**, run `max_model_len=1048576`
with `max_num_seqs=6`. Every request can still grow to 1M while up to 6 sessions
run at once, because the shared KV pool — not a per-slot reservation — is the
real limit (see [How the KV cache works](#how-the-kv-cache-works-why-1m--concurrency-is-safe)).

Validated on the 2026-06-29 code-completion microbench deployment (NVFP4,
`max_model_len=1048576`, `max_num_seqs=6`,
`VLLM_DSPARK_GPU_REJECTED_CONTEXT_MASK=1`, `VLLM_USE_B12X_WO_PROJECTION=1`):

- Boot: `GPU KV cache size: 1,901,239 tokens`, `Maximum concurrency for 1,048,576 tokens per request: 1.81x`
- 6 concurrent requests: **6/6 success**, **~182 tok/s aggregate** (~30 tok/s per stream), no OOM / no preemption failures
- Single-stream decode on this same profile: ~67 tok/s (code)

This is the right shape when most sessions sit far below 1M (typical agent
turns) but you still want the 1M ceiling available. The newer 2026-06-30
agent-stability checkpoint above is the safer number to cite for Hermes/OpenClaw
harness validation.

> Higher concurrency is not free: under sustained pressure you can see added
> scheduler churn, prefill contention, and KV fragmentation. 1M/6 is validated
> for normal-length agent traffic; for guaranteed deep-context work under load,
> 1M/2 is conservative and 500K/4 is a balanced middle.

## How the KV cache works (why 1M + concurrency is safe)

> [!NOTE]
> `max_model_len` and `max_num_seqs` are ceilings, not reservations. The real
> limit is the sum of live tokens across active requests fitting inside the
> shared KV pool.

Three independent knobs, often confused:

| knob | what it is | this build |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **KV cache pool** | total shared KV memory in tokens, sized from `gpu_memory_utilization` after weights load | about 3.2M tokens in the C12 checkpoint |
| `max_model_len` | per-request **ceiling** — how long any one request may grow | 1,048,576 (1M) |
| `max_num_seqs` | **concurrency cap** — max active sequences the scheduler runs at once | 6 |

The pool is **shared and allocated on demand**: PagedAttention hands KV blocks
to each request as it generates tokens and frees them when it finishes.
`max_model_len` and `max_num_seqs` are **ceilings, not reservations** — vLLM does
NOT pre-allocate `max_num_seqs × max_model_len` of KV. So the real constraint is:

```
sum(live tokens across all active requests) <= KV pool
```

Worked examples at 1M ceiling / 6 slots:

```
6 requests x  50k tokens =  300k   fits easily
6 requests x 200k tokens =  1.2M   fits in the C12 checkpoint pool
6 requests x 500k tokens =  3.0M   ~near the C12 checkpoint pool
3 requests x 1M   tokens =  3.0M   ~near the C12 checkpoint pool
6 requests x 1M   tokens =  6.0M   impossible — excess requests queue/preempt
```

The boot log's `Maximum concurrency for 1,048,576 tokens per request: ~1.9x`
only means about two *simultaneous full-1M* requests fit. But agent turns are
almost never near 1M, so six normal-length sessions share the pool while the
1M ceiling stays available for the rare long one. That is exactly why
`1M + max_num_seqs=6` is useful: you are not reserving 6×1M, you are sharing
one pool across short requests under a high ceiling.

## Gotcha: gibberish, loops, Chinese drift, or prompt/XML leakage

If the model boots and basic prompts like `hi` work, but real agent traffic
randomly turns into repeated characters, Chinese drift, leaked tool/schema XML,
or Telegram-visible junk, do not assume the weights are bad.

On this deployment there are three checks to make before blaming the weights:

1. **Runtime concurrency safety:** make sure the bind-mounted proposer at
   `recipe/vllm/v1/spec_decode/dspark_proposer.py` is present on both nodes.
   It must keep Keys' `req_ids` slot mapping and Patch 2b ragged
   `query_start_loc` handling, and it must include the non-uniform batch guard
   at `propose()` entry. Without the guard, mixed prefill/decode steps under
   `--async-scheduling` and `--enable-chunked-prefill` can raise
   `ValueError: DSpark currently requires uniform flattened per-request inputs`
   and kill the engine at concurrency >= 2. The baked-in overlay copy in
   `recipe/overlay/vllm/v1/spec_decode/dspark_proposer.py` is the image-build
   source; the bind-mounted `recipe/vllm/...` copy is what the live compose
   file overrides at runtime.
2. **Runtime image provenance:** make sure the image really contains the current
   DSpark overlay. A reused local tag named `vllm-dspark-runtime:clean` caused
   misleading failures even though a nearby PR-head image worked. Rebuild from
   the intended overlay commit when in doubt.
3. **Decode/fallback safety:** for long OpenAI-compatible agent prompts, avoid
   unstable sampling and hidden fallback transitions. The server keeps
   `--generation-config vllm` and does not install a server-side
   `--override-generation-config`; explicit client request parameters still
   win.

The compose launcher includes `--generation-config vllm`, sets `thinking=false`,
uses DSpark speculative decoding with `MTP_NUM_TOKENS=3` and
`draft_sample_method=probabilistic`, and enables the FlashInfer sampler. For
exact deterministic curl checks, send `temperature: 0` in the request body.

Also clear agent fallback lists during validation. A model that looks fixed in
direct vLLM tests can still appear poisoned if the orchestration layer silently
falls back, reboots a session, or replays a stale prompt/tool transcript into
the visible message stream. Keep OpenClaw/Hermes changes separate from model
runtime validation unless you are deliberately testing that harness.

Validation gates to run after a live fix:

```text
direct vLLM prompts: clean
direct concurrent vLLM prompts: clean
agent harness prompts: clean, DeepSeek, no fallback
MTP3 probabilistic draft sampling active
```

This keeps NVFP4 KV and MTP3. Do not switch to fp8 or drop to a smaller fallback
model just to hide the symptom unless you intentionally accept the context and
quality tradeoff.

## Known issue: output corruption under speculation + concurrency

> [!WARNING]
> Long agentic sessions with **more than one request decoding concurrently and
> speculative decoding enabled** have shown silent output corruption on this
> stack: isolated junk tokens (random CJK/Greek/rare-vocab) inside coherent
> text, literal `<|begin_of_sentence|>` emitted as text followed by replay of
> stale earlier answers (prefix caching makes one corrupted committed token
> poison the session's cached prefix for every later turn), generation jumping
> into verbatim copies of earlier context, and DSML tool markup leaking as
> plain text. Bisection: sampling overrides and `draft_sample_method=greedy`
> did not help; `MTP_NUM_TOKENS=0` (speculation off) removed it completely.

**Root-cause status.** One concrete defect is identified and fixed in-tree:
the proposer's non-uniform-batch guard used to *fabricate* `[batch, K]` drafts
of token id `0` (a live vocab entry — begin-of-sentence) instead of signalling
"no proposal", and those fabricated drafts reached probabilistic rejection
sampling paired with stale-or-absent draft probabilities, which can accept
them. The guard now sets per-request draft lengths to zero so the runner
schedules **no** speculative tokens for that step (`dspark_proposer.py`,
`_skip_speculation_this_step`). Note the timeline: the 2026-06-30 checkpoint
forced `temperature 0.0` (greedy verification rejects fabricated drafts by
construction) and validated clean; C12 removed that override, opening the
window. Whether further misalignment exists in the ragged path remains
unproven — hence the ladder below.

**Mitigation ladder** (in increasing order of speedup sacrificed):

| level | knob | effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 (always on) | fixed guard | guard-fired steps schedule zero spec tokens instead of fabricated id-0 drafts |
| 1 | `VLLM_DSPARK_SKIP_RAGGED_SPECULATION=1` | skip speculation on **mixed prefill/decode steps only**; uniform decode steps (the steady-state majority) keep full speculation — the suspect ragged machinery never runs |
| 2 | `GREEDY_VERIFICATION=1` | server forces `temperature 0.0/top_p 1.0` (the clean 2026-06-30 profile); full speculation speedup, deterministic outputs |
| 3 | `MTP_NUM_TOKENS=0` | speculation fully off (now correctly omits `--speculative-config`); ~52–57 → ~18–19 tok/s single-stream |

`DRAFT_SAMPLE_METHOD` (default `probabilistic`) is also parameterized for
bisection.

**Validation gotcha:** a client session whose history already contains leaked
markers keeps *imitating* them against a healthy server. Verify any fix with a
server restart (prefix cache reset) **and fresh client sessions** — use
`scripts/dspark-corruption-soak.py`, which builds fresh sessions and detects
the corruption signatures automatically. The upstream-vLLM lane
(`docs/UPSTREAM-VLLM-GB10-BRANCH.md`) reimplements this machinery entirely and
must pass the same soak before adoption.

## Important Caveat

### Special thanks

**[drowzeys ("Keys")](https://github.com/drowzeys/)** — this repo would not run
correctly under real concurrency without Keys' public work. Keys published the
DSpark in-server concurrency patch, the request-stable main-KV slot mapping, the
ragged `query_start_loc` path for mixed prefill/decode batches, and the early
`nvfp4_ds_mla` KV-cache wiring on DGX Spark. Our overlay, bind-mounted
proposer, and measured concurrency numbers all build directly on that
foundation.

`ip addr show enp1s0f0np0` on both nodes if the cable has moved, since the
`f0`/`f1` suffix follows the physical port):

```env
WORKER_HOST=alessangiorgi@10.0.0.2
MASTER_ADDR=10.0.0.1
VLLM_HOST_IP=10.0.0.1
WORKER_VLLM_HOST_IP=10.0.0.2
MASTER_PORT=25000
NCCL_IB_HCA=rocep1s0f0
NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME=enp1s0f0np0
```

The link runs `10.0.0.0/30` at MTU 9000 and validated at ~109 Gbps / ~1.45 µs;
`NCCL_NET_PLUGIN=none` and `NCCL_IB_MERGE_NICS=1` are useful when diagnosing
NCCL transport selection.

Keep these agent-serving defaults unless you are deliberately experimenting:

- `VLLM_HOST=0.0.0.0` if Hermes/OpenClaw or another machine must reach the API
- `MAX_MODEL_LEN=1048576`
- `MAX_NUM_SEQS=6`
- `GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION=0.85`
- `MTP_NUM_TOKENS=3`
- `VLLM_USE_FLASHINFER_SAMPLER=1`
- `VLLM_DSPARK_GPU_REJECTED_CONTEXT_MASK=1`
- `VLLM_USE_B12X_WO_PROJECTION=1`
- `VLLM_MEMORY_PROFILER_ESTIMATE_CUDAGRAPHS=0`

Build the base overlay and Stage C NVFP4 image:

```bash
./build-dspark-vllm-runtime.sh
```

Prepare the model cache:

```bash
./prepare-dspark-model-cache.sh
```

Start the service:

```bash
./start-deepseek-v4-flash-dspark.sh
```

Optional experimental GB10 hybrid NVFP4 plugin:

```bash
ENABLE_VLLM_GB10_PATCH=1 ./start-deepseek-v4-flash-dspark.sh
```

When enabled, the launcher syncs `vllm_patch_gb10/` to the worker, mounts it in
both containers, installs it with `pip install -e --no-deps`, sets
`VLLM_PLUGINS=gb10_hybrid_nvfp4`, and starts vLLM with
`--quantization modelopt_gb10_hybrid`. The default is disabled. Tune the
dispatcher threshold with `GB10_HYBRID_NVFP4_M_THRESHOLD`; the default is `128`.

The start script prints the resolved non-secret runtime profile, syncs the
compose/env files and the bind-mounted `dspark_proposer.py` to the worker path,
validates rendered Docker Compose on both nodes, starts the worker first, then
starts the head and follows startup logs while waiting for the API. If startup
fails, it prints recent head and worker logs before exiting.

The API serves at:

```text
http://HEAD_NODE_IP:8888/v1
```

For head-node-only tests, set `VLLM_HOST=127.0.0.1`. For Hermes/OpenClaw or
another machine to use the endpoint, keep `VLLM_HOST=0.0.0.0` and control
access at the network/firewall layer.

## Runtime Profile

### C12 Agent-Serving Profile

Core vLLM flags:

- `--tensor-parallel-size 2`
- `--distributed-executor-backend mp`
- `--nnodes 2`
- `--kv-cache-dtype nvfp4_ds_mla`
- `--block-size 256`
- `--max-model-len 1048576`
- `--max-num-seqs 6`
- `--max-num-batched-tokens 8192`
- `--max-cudagraph-capture-size 24` (`max_num_seqs * (MTP_NUM_TOKENS + 1)` → `6 * 4`)
- `--gpu-memory-utilization 0.85`
- `--async-scheduling`
- `--enable-chunked-prefill`
- `--speculative-config '{"method":"dspark","num_speculative_tokens":${MTP_NUM_TOKENS:-3},"draft_sample_method":"probabilistic"}'`
- `--generation-config vllm`

Key runtime env:

- `ENABLE_VLLM_GB10_PATCH=0` by default; set to `1` to load the optional
  `vllm_patch_gb10/` plugin and add `--quantization modelopt_gb10_hybrid`
- `GB10_HYBRID_NVFP4_M_THRESHOLD=128`
- `VLLM_USE_FLASHINFER_SAMPLER=1`
- `VLLM_USE_B12X_MOE=1`
- `VLLM_USE_B12X_WO_PROJECTION=1`
- `VLLM_DSPARK_GPU_REJECTED_CONTEXT_MASK=1`
- `VLLM_DSPARK_CONFIDENCE_SCHEDULER=off`
- `VLLM_DSPARK_LOCAL_ARGMAX=1`
- `VLLM_DSPARK_REPLICATE_MARKOV_W1=1`
- `VLLM_DSPARK_FUSED_MARKOV_ARGMAX=0`
- `VLLM_DSPARK_REFERENCE_KV_QUANT_DEQUANT=0`
- `VLLM_DSV4_B12X_COMPRESSED_MLA=0`
- `VLLM_DSV4_DSPARK_DEFER_TARGET_CAPTURE=0`
- `B12X_W4A16_TC_DECODE=0`

### 200k Concurrency Profile

For DSpark concurrency, use the included overlay files with Keys'
concurrency patch and set:

- `MAX_MODEL_LEN=200000`
- `MAX_NUM_SEQS=16`
- `VLLM_USE_B12X_WO_PROJECTION=1`
- `VLLM_DSPARK_GPU_REJECTED_CONTEXT_MASK=1`

### 1M Single-Stream Legacy Profile

For conservative single-stream testing, set `MAX_NUM_SEQS=1` and
`VLLM_USE_B12X_WO_PROJECTION=0`. Keep `MTP_NUM_TOKENS=3` unless you are
deliberately running an experiment; the current local runtime uses
probabilistic DSpark draft sampling at MTP3.

## Verify

After launch:

```bash
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8888/v1/models
```

Confirm the returned model entry reports:

```json
"max_model_len": 1048576
```

Then check logs:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.dspark -f docker-compose.dspark.yml logs vllm-dspark \
  | grep -E "GPU KV cache size|Maximum concurrency"
```

Expected C12 checkpoint values are around:

```text
GPU KV cache size: approximately 2M tokens
Maximum concurrency for 1,048,576 tokens per request: approximately 1.9x
```

Before pointing an agent harness at the endpoint, run the included smoke test:

```bash
./smoke-deepseek-v4-flash-dspark.sh
```

If direct OpenAI-compatible prompts are clean but an agent still garbles,
investigate the agent session, fallback list, or harness prompt replay before
blaming the DSpark weights.

## Notes

- The old speed checkpoint is single stream, not aggregate throughput.
- The high-concurrency benchmark is aggregate throughput and was validated at
  `max_model_len=200000`, not full 1M context.
- Full context and high concurrency compete for the same KV pool. The C12
  1M profile is intended for normal agent traffic where most sessions sit far
  below the 1M ceiling; it is not twelve simultaneous full-1M requests.
- To combine DSpark concurrency with longer context, pick a lower context
  target first, then raise concurrency slowly while watching boot logs, KV
  allocation, acceptance, and request errors.
- 1M was validated as booted/advertised `max_model_len` with KV headroom and
  short-prompt speed probes. This repo does not claim a full 1M-token retrieval
  or correctness benchmark.
- The measured probes were p256/p512 with g64/g256. Rebenchmark if you change
  sampling, batching, context length, WO projection, compressed MLA, or the
  confidence scheduler.
- The current configured agent-serving profile is `MAX_MODEL_LEN=1048576`,
  `MAX_NUM_SEQS=6`, `GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION=0.85`,
  `MTP_NUM_TOKENS=3`, `VLLM_USE_FLASHINFER_SAMPLER=1`,
  `VLLM_DSPARK_GPU_REJECTED_CONTEXT_MASK=1`,
  `VLLM_USE_B12X_WO_PROJECTION=1`, no generation override, and
  `VLLM_DSV4_B12X_COMPRESSED_MLA=0`.
- Worker-first startup avoids a race during multi-node `mp` initialization and
  now validates rendered compose on both nodes before starting containers.
- Requires matching images on both nodes, correct NCCL/RoCE settings, and a
  two-node Blackwell-class/DGX Spark setup.
- It is recommended to **disable earlyoom** on the DGX Spark hosts (`sudo systemctl stop earlyoom && sudo systemctl disable earlyoom`).
  The earlyoom daemon can OOM-kill vLLM worker or head processes under high GPU
  memory pressure (e.g., during concurrent deep-context workloads), even when the
  system has available swap or the OOM is transient. Disabling it avoids spurious
  process termination and service disruption.
- The API binds to `127.0.0.1` by default; exposing it is a deliberate security
  choice.
- The next max-sequence ladder to try is approximately 1.25M, 1.5M, then
  1.75M, with the same boot/log/speed gates. Raw KV math alone is not enough
  because DeepSeek V4 sparse MLA also allocates max-length-dependent workspaces.
